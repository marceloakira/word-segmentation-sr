We aim to overcome these limitations by learning compounding morphology from inflectional information derived from lemmatized monolingual corpora.

Most of the existing researches on feature-level opinion mining are dedicated to extract explicitly appeared features and opinion words. However, among the numerous kinds of reviews on the web, there are a significant number of reviews that contain only opinion words which imply some product features. The identification of such implicit features is still one of the most challenge tasks in opinion mining. In this paper, we propose a classification-based approach to deal with the task of implicit feature identification. Firstly, by exploiting the word segmentation, part-of-speech(POS) tagging and dependency parsing, a rule based method to extract the explicit feature-opinion pairs is presented. Secondly, the feature-opinion pairs for each opinion word are clustered and the training documents for each clustered feature-opinion pair are then constructed. Finally, the identification of implicit features is formulated into a classification-based feature selection.

Building a sound labeler requires very large number of correctly labeled training examples, which may not always be possible. On the other hand, crowdsourcing provides an inexpensive yet efficient alternative to collect manual sequential labeling from non-experts. However the quality of crowd labeling cannot be guaranteed, and three kinds of errors are typical: (1) incorrect annotations due to lack of expertise (e.g., labeling gene names from plain text requires corresponding domain knowledge); (2) ignored or omitted annotations due to carelessness or low confidence; (3) noisy annotations due to cheating or vandalism. To correct these mistakes, we present Sembler, a statistical model for ensembling crowd sequential labelings. Sembler considers three types of statistical information: (1) the majority agreement that proves the correctness of an annotation; (2) correct annotation that improves the credibility of the corresponding annotator; (3) correct annotation that enhances the correctness of other annotations which share similar linguistic or contextual features. We evaluate the proposed model on a real Twitter and a synthetical biological data set, and find that Sembler is particularly accurate when more than half of annotators make mistakes.

We discuss how the existing techniques can be viewed asintroducing additional assumptions to the basic BMR framework, and describe a generic yet efficient implementation called word synchronous beam search.Testing the framework and its implementation on a series of large scale experiments reveals the following. First, the language style used to build the modelplays a critical role in the word breaking task, and the most suitable for the URL word breaking task appears to be that ofthe document title where the best performance is obtained. Models created from other language styles, such as from document body, anchor text, and even queries, exhibit varying degrees of mismatch. Although all styles benefit from increasing modeling power which, in our experiments, corresponds tothe use of a higher order N-gram, the gain is most recognizable for the title model. The heuristics proposed by the prior arts do contribute to the word breaking performance for mismatched or less powerful models, but are less effective and, in many cases,lead to poorer performance than the matched model with minimal assumptions. For the matched model based on document titles, an accuracy rate of 97.18\% can already be achieved using simple trigram without any heuristics.

In this paper, the use of an ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic is proposed for a linguistic task that involves the automated morphological segmentation of Ancient Greek word forms into stem and ending. The task of morphological analysis is essential for implementing text-processing applications such as semantic analysis and information retrieval. The difficulty of the morphological analysis task differs depending on the language chosen, being hardest in the case of highly-inflectional languages, where each stem may be associated with a large number of different endings. In this paper, focus is placed on the morphological analysis of ancient Greek, which has been shown to be a particularly hard task. To perform this task, a system for the automated morphological processing has been proposed, which implements the morphological analysis of words by coupling an iterative pattern-recognition algorithm with a modest amount of linguistic knowledge, expressed via a set of interactions associated with weights. In an earlier version of the system, these weights were determined by combining the input from specialized scientists with a lengthy manual optimization process. In this paper, the ACO metaheuristic is applied to the task of defining near-optimal system weights using an automated process based on a set of training data. The experiments performed indicate that the segmentation quality achieved by ACO is equivalent to or in several cases substantially higher than that achieved using manually optimized weights.","","information retrieval, Information retrieval, Data mining, text analysis, optimisation, Performance analysis, natural language processing, Algorithm design and analysis, Information analysis, ancient Greek, Ancient Greek, ant colony metaheuristic, Ant colony optimization, ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic, automated morphological analysis, automated morphological processing, heuristic function, highly-inflectional languages, Iterative algorithms, iterative methods, iterative pattern-recognition algorithm, linguistic knowledge, linguistics, manual optimization process, morphological analysis, near-optimal system, optimize automatic word segmentation, Pattern analysis, pattern recognition, segmentation quality, semantic analysis, text processing, Text processing, text processing application, Training data","",""

Secondly, we propose and study a novel application of twitter hashtag segmentation for increasing recall on twitter searches. Existing methods for word segmentation use unsupervised language models. We find that when using multiple corpora, the joint probability model from multiple corpora performs significantly better than the individual corpora. Motivated by this, we propose weighted joint probability model, with weights specific to each corpus. We propose to train the weights in a supervised manner using max-margin methods. The supervised probability models improve segmentation accuracy over joint probability models. Finally, we observe that length of segments is an important parameter for word segmentation, and incorporate length-specific weights into our model. The length specific models further improve segmentation accuracy over supervised probability models. For all models proposed here, inference problem can be solved using the dynamic programming algorithm. We test our methods on five different datasets, two from web domains data, and three from news headlines data from an LDC dataset. The supervised length specific models show significant improvements over unsupervised single corpus and joint probability models. Cross-testing between the datasets confirm that supervised probability models trained on all datasets, and length specific models trained on news headlines data, generalize well.

Compounds constitute a specific issue in search, in particular in languages where they are written in one word, as is the case for Danish and the other Scandinavian languages. For such languages, expansion of the query compound into separate lemmas is a way of finding the often frequent alternative synonymous phrases in which the content of a compound can also be expressed. However, it is crucial to note that the number of irrelevant hits is generally very high when using this expansion strategy. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine how we can obtain better search results on split compounds, partly by looking at the internal structure of the original compound, partly by analyzing the context in which the split compound occurs. In this context, we pursue two hypotheses: (1) that some categories of compounds are more likely to have synonymous 'split' counterparts than others; and (2) that search results where both the search words (obtained by splitting the compound) occur in the same noun phrase, are more likely to contain a synonymous phrase to the original compound query. The search results from 410 enhanced compound queries are used as a test bed for our experiments. On these search results, we perform a shallow linguistic analysis and introduce a new, linguistically based threshold for retrieved hits. The results obtained by using this strategy demonstrate that compound splitting combined with a shallow linguistic analysis focusing on the argument structure of the compound head as well as on the recognition of NPs, can improve search by substantially bringing down the number of irrelevant hits. © 2006 Cambridge University Press.","","","",""

In the first step, an iterative bootstrap method is applied to learn multiple segmentation schemes that are consistent with the phrasal segmentations of an SMT system trained on the resegmented bitext. In the second step, multiple segmentation schemes are integrated into a single SMT system by characterizing the source language side and merging identical translation pairs of differently segmented SMT models.

In short text, abbreviations such as "ASAP" or "joinus" and emoticons are often used. Because these expressions are not registered into the existing dictionaries, these are analyzed as unknown expressions. That can be a bottleneck for improving accuracy of reputation analysis in text mining. To use context for unknown word clustering is a major method, however, it usually requires word segmentation process and it has weakness for split errors of unknown expressions such as youth slang. In this paper, we proposed a method to obtain the appropriate context even though unknown expressions cause split errors and estimate sensibility expressed in the text. Because the dimensions of the obtained context vector were enormous, we also proposed a method to create a feature vector based on the co-occurrence of the sensibility words as simple expression with low dimension.

We focus on the question of whether semantic transparency is best viewed as a property of the entire multimorphemic string or as a property of constituent morphemes. Accordingly, we investigated the processing of English compound nouns that were categorized in terms of the semantic transparency of each of their constituents. Fully transparent such as bedroom are those in which the meanings of each of the constituents are transparently represented in the meaning of the compound as a whole. These compounds were contrasted with compounds such as strawberry, in which only the second constituent is semantically transparent, jailbird, in which only the first constituent is transparent, and hogwash, in which neither constituent is semantically transparent. We propose that significant insights can be achieved through such analysis of the transparency of individual morphemes. The two experiments that we report present evidence that both semantically transparent compounds and semantically opaque compounds show morphological constituency. The semantic transparency of the morphological head (the second constituent in a morphologically right-headed language such as English) was found to play a significant role in overall lexical decision latencies, in patterns of decomposition, and in the effects of stimulus repetition within the experiment.","","","",""

Memory and time constraints allow to take only a fixed number of words into account, which leads to the out-of-vocabulary (OOV) problem. In this work, we analyze why the OOV problem arises and why it is considered a serious problem in German. We study the effectiveness of compound word splitters for alleviating the OOV problem, resulting in a 2.5+ BLEU points improvement over a baseline on the WMT' 14 German-to-English translation task.

To this aim, researchers have proposed several identifier splitting and expansion approaches such as Samurai, TIDIER and more recently GenTest. The ultimate goal of such approaches is to help disambiguating conceptual information encoded in compound (or abbreviated) identifiers. This paper presents TRIS, TRee-based Identifier Splitter, a two-phases approach to split and expand program identifiers. First, TRIS pre-compiles transformed dictionary words into a tree representation, associating a cost to each transformation. In a second phase, it maps the identifier splitting/expansion problem into a minimization problem, i.e., the search of the shortest path (optimal split/expansion) in a weighted graph. We apply TRIS to a sample of 974 identifiers extracted from JHotDraw, 3,085 from Lynx, and to a sample of 489 identifiers extracted from 340 C programs. Also, we compare TRIS with GenTest on a set of 2,663 mixed Java, C and C++ identifiers. We report evidence that TRIS split (and expansion) is more accurate than state-of-the-art approaches and that it is also efficient in terms of computation time. © 2012 IEEE.","","","",""

Among other factors, recent studies have shown that a proper choice of identifiers influences understandability and maintainability. Indeed, identifiers are developers' main source of information and guide their cognitive processes during program comprehension when high-level documentation is scarce or outdated and when source code is not sufficiently commented. This paper proposes a novel approach to recognize words composing source code identifiers. The approach is based on an adaptation of Dynamic Time Warping used to recognize words in continuous speech. The approach overcomes the limitations of existing identifier-splitting approaches when naming conventions (e.g., Camel Case) are not used or when identifiers contain abbreviations. We apply the approach on a sample of more than 1000 identifiers extracted from 340 C programs and compare its results with a simple Camel Case splitter and with an implementation of an alternative identifier splitting approach, Samurai. Results indicate the capability of the novel approach: (i) to outperform the alternative ones, when using a dictionary augmented with domain knowledge or a contextual dictionary and (ii) to expand 48\% of a set of selected abbreviations into dictionary words.

No previous studies, however, exist on the effect of decomposition of compounds in IR for Indian languages. In this case study, we investigate the effect of decompounding for Bengali, a highly agglutinative Indian language. The standard approach of decompounding for IR, i.e. indexing compound parts (constituents) in addition to compound words, has proven beneficial for European languages. Our experiments reported in this paper show that such a standard approach does not work particularly well for Bengali IR. Some unique characteristics of Bengali compounds are: i) only one compound constituent may be a valid word in contrast to the stricter requirement of both being so; and ii) the first character of the right constituent can be modified by the rules of Sandhi in contrast to simple concatenation. As a solution, we firstly propose a more relaxed decompounding where a compound word is decomposed into only one constituent if the other constituent is not a valid word, and secondly we perform selective decompounding by ensuring that constituents often co-occur with the compound word, which indicates how related the constituents and the compound are. We perform experiments on Bengali ad-hoc IR collections from FIRE 2008 to 2012. Our experiments show that both the relaxed decomposition and the co-occurrence-based constituent selection proves more effective than the standard frequency-based decomposition method, improving mean average precision (MAP) up to 2.72\% and recall up to 1.8\%, compared to not decompounding words.","","","",""

The first step in analyzing words from identifiers requires splitting identifiers into their constituent words. Unlike natural languages, where space and punctuation are used to delineate words, identifiers cannot contain spaces. One common way to split identifiers is to follow programming language naming conventions. For example, Java programmers often use camel case, where words are delineated by uppercase letters or non-alphabetic characters. However, programmers also create identifiers by concatenating sequences of words together with no discernible delineation, which poses challenges to automatic identifier splitting. In this paper, we present an algorithm to automatically split identifiers into sequences of words by mining word frequencies in source code. With these word frequencies, our identifier splitter uses a scoring technique to automatically select the most appropriate partitioning for an identifier. In an evaluation of over 8000 identifiers from open source Java programs, our Samurai approach outperforms the existing state of the art techniques.","","Natural languages, data mining, Java, software maintenance, Software maintenance, program diagnostics, Frequency, automatic split identifier, Information analysis, Open source software, Programming profession, Quality assessment, software analysis, Software quality, Software tools, source code mining, word frequency mining","",""

The main research question that we ask in this study is if we had a perfect technique for splitting identifiers, would it still help improve accuracy of feature location techniques applied in different scenarios and settings? In order to answer this research question we investigate two feature location techniques, one based on Information Retrieval and the other one based on the combination of Information Retrieval and dynamic analysis, for locating bugs and features using various configurations of preprocessing strategies on two open-source systems, Rhino and jEdit. The results of an extensive empirical evaluation reveal that feature location techniques using Information Retrieval can benefit from better preprocessing algorithms in some cases, and that their improvement in effectiveness while using manual splitting over state-of-the-art approaches is statistically significant in those cases. However, the results for feature location technique using the combination of Information Retrieval and dynamic analysis do not show any improvement while using manual splitting, indicating that any preprocessing technique will suffice if execution data is available. Overall, our findings outline potential benefits of putting additional research efforts into defining more sophisticated source code preprocessing techniques as they can still be useful in situations where execution information cannot be easily collected.","","information retrieval, Manuals, Dictionaries, Samurai, Software, dynamic analysis, feature location, identifier splitting algorithms, Algorithm design and analysis, Accuracy, CamelCase, feature location technique, Gold, identifier splitting technique, jEdit, Large scale integration, open source system, preprocessing strategies, Rhino","",""

Every query term is truncated so as to increase recall by hopefully finding other compounds with the leading constituent as prefix. This approach increases recall in a rather uncontrolled way, so we use a Boolean quorum-level search method to rank documents both according to a tf-idf factor but also to the number of matching Boolean combinations.

Indeed the lexical information embedded in the source code can be valuable for tasks such as concept location, clustering or recovery of traceability links. The application of such IR-based techniques relies on the consistency of the lexicon available in the different artifacts, and their effectiveness can worsen if programmers introduce abbreviations (e.g: rect) and/or do not strictly follow naming conventions such as Camel Case (e.g: UTFtoASCII). In this paper we propose an approach to automatically split identifiers in their composing words, and expand abbreviations. The solution is based on a graph model and performs in linear time with respect to the size of the dictionary, taking advantage of an approximate string matching technique. The proposed technique exploits a number of different dictionaries, referring to increasingly broader contexts, in order to achieve a disambiguation strategy based on the knowledge gathered from the most appropriate domain. The approach has been compared to other splitting and expansion techniques, using freely available oracles for the identifiers extracted from 24 C/C++ and Java open source systems. Results show an improvement in both splitting and expanding performance, in addition to a strong enhancement in the computational efficiency.","","Context, information retrieval, abbreviation expansion, approximate string matching technique, Approximation algorithms, C-C++, C++ language, camel case, concept location, Conferences, Dictionaries, dictionary, disambiguation strategy, Expansion, identifier splitting, information retrieval techniques, IR-based techniques, Java, Java open source systems, lexical information, LINSEN, oracles, pattern clustering, Program Comprehension, public domain software, Software algorithms, software maintenance, Software maintenance, software maintenance activities, Source Code Identifiers, Splitting, traceability links clustering, traceability links recovery","",""

In this paper, we present a framework to build an MSN robot that can chat with students to provide campus information. The MSN robot has two major functions; that is it can provide two kinds of information: curriculum information and living information. The curriculum information includes a road map of all courses so that students can register courses according to their interests and future plans. The living information includes the information of restaurants, houses, transportation, and scenic spots around the campus. The MSN robot consists of three components: word segmentation and POS tagging, natural language understanding, and response text generation. The chat between the robot and students starts with an input of free-text question about campus information. Once the question is received, the natural language understanding component determines the meaning of the input question using classification methods. Finally, the output component generates a text response using a set of predefined templates. The MSN robot is implemented using the Dot MSN, an open source package that can connect the MSN Messenger service. The experimental results show that among several classification methods the support vector machine (SVM) achieves the best performance in classifying users' input questions into curriculum information or living information. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.","","","",""

In our field of study, the German medical language, the amount of compounds significantly outnumbers this figure with 64\%. Thus, their correct splitting is a high-impact preprocessing step for any NLP-based application. In this work we address two challenges of medical decomposition: First, we introduce the consideration of unknown constituents in order to split compounds that were not recognized as such so far. Second, our approach builds on the corpus-based approach of Koehn and Knight and adds semantic knowledge from domain ontologies to increase the accuracy during disambiguation of the various split options. Using this first-of-a-kind semantic approach in a study on decomposition of German medical compounds, we outperform the existing approaches by far. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015.","","","",""

For the boundary detection the challenge of increasing recall of found morphs while retaining a high precision is tackled by adding a compound splitter, iterating the LSV analysis and dividing the trie classifier into two distinctly applied clasifiers. The result is a significantly improved overall performance and a decreased reliance on corpus size. Further possible improvements and analyses are discussed.","","","",""

Configuration and preprocessing decisions are required to build a suitable source code corpus for a static analysis technique. Currently, there is little guidance in the software engineering literature for making such configuration decisions.

We experiment on three open source Java test suites, i.e. Mylyn 1.0.1, Rhino 1.5R5, and Rhino 1.6R5.
