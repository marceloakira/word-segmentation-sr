The system contains four main components: knowledge graphs, text processing, text analysis and intelligent report. First, the system has built a semantic-rich knowledge base using several knowledge graph resources. A novel text processing and analysis framework based on knowledge graphs is developed and implemented. Given a text dataset, the text processing phase will do data cleaning, word segmentation and feature extraction for it. With the extracted features, the text analysis phase allows users to select a text mining task. We have implemented the proposed novel algorithm and several typical algorithms for each task. If users select multiple algorithms for the task, the intelligent report phase will automatically generate comparison results for users. Especially, the intelligent report phase also provides users a paper summary generating function on text mining problems. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018.},

Then, through the way of template matching, semantic comprehension finally forms the code form that can control the home node. In the system applied in this paper, the speech is processed into words through the existing voice input function of the mobile terminal. Then, the control instruction is obtained through the language processing method. The processed data is communicated to the server via socket.

We use segmented text to extract characteristics according to the characteristic templates which had been trained in the training phase, and then calculate (Formula presented.) to get the best result from the input sequence.

  abstract      = {Social networking sites such as Twitter provide more opportunities to express what people think or intend in short text. In short text, abbreviations such as "ASAP" or "joinus" and emoticons are often used. Because these expressions are not registered into the existing dictionaries, these are analyzed as unknown expressions. That can be a bottleneck for improving accuracy of reputation analysis in text mining. To use context for unknown word clustering is a major method, however, it usually requires word segmentation process and it has weakness for split errors of unknown expressions such as youth slang. In this paper, we proposed a method to obtain the appropriate context even though unknown expressions cause split errors and estimate sensibility expressed in the text. Because the dimensions of the obtained context vector were enormous, we also proposed a method to create a feature vector based on the co-occurrence of the sensibility words as simple expression with low dimension. As an evaluation experiment, the proposed method showed certain accuracy even with the small training data. © 2015 IEEE.},

  abstract = {ESA is an unsupervised approach to word segmentation previously proposed by Wang, which is an iterative process consisting of three phases: Evaluation, Selection and Adjustment. In this article, we propose ExESA, the extension of ESA. In ExESA, the original approach is extended to a 2-pass process and the ratio of different word lengths is introduced as the third type of information combined with cohesion and separation. A maximum strategy is adopted to determine the best segmentation of a character sequence in the phrase of Selection. Besides, in Adjustment, ExESA re-evaluates separation information and individual information to overcome the overestimation frequencies. Additionally, a smoothing algorithm is applied to alleviate sparseness. The experiment results show that ExESA can further improve the performance and is time-saving by properly utilizing more information from un-annotated corpora. Moreover, the parameters of ExESA can be predicted by a set of empirical formulae or combined with the minimum description length principle.},

An input method is software used to type sentences in languages which have far more characters than the number of keys on a keyboard. The main contributions of this paper are: 1) an input method server that proposes word candidates which are not included in the vocabulary, 2) a publicly usable input method that logs user behavior (like typing and selection of word candidates), and 3) a method for improving word segmentation by using these logs. We conducted word segmentation experiments on tweets from Twitter, and showed that our method improves accuracy in this domain.

However, stress is neither invariably produced nor unambiguously identifiable in real speech. Heavy syllables, i.e. those with long vowels or syllable codas, attract stress in English. We devise Adaptor Grammar word segmentation models that exploit either stress, or syllable weight, or both, and evaluate the utility of syllable weight as a cue to word boundaries.

Most of the existing researches on feature-level opinion mining are dedicated to extract explicitly appeared features and opinion words. However, among the numerous kinds of reviews on the web, there are a significant number of reviews that contain only opinion words which imply some product features. The identification of such implicit features is still one of the most challenge tasks in opinion mining. In this paper, we propose a classification-based approach to deal with the task of implicit feature identification. Firstly, by exploiting the word segmentation, part-of-speech(POS) tagging and dependency parsing, a rule based method to extract the explicit feature-opinion pairs is presented. Secondly, the feature-opinion pairs for each opinion word are clustered and the training documents for each clustered feature-opinion pair are then constructed. Finally, the identification of implicit features is formulated into a classification-based feature selection. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms the existing methods significantly. © Springer-Verlag 2013.},

Compared to a pipelined approach in which segmentation is performed first, our model is qualitatively more similar to human learners. On data with variable pronunciations, the pipelined approach learns to treat syllables or morphemes as words. In contrast, our joint model, like infant learners, tends to learn multiword collocations. We also conduct analyses of the phonetic variations that the model learns to accept and its patterns of word recognition errors, and relate these to developmental evidence. © 2013 Association for Computational Linguistics.},

The curriculum information includes a road map of all courses so that students can register courses according to their interests and future plans. The living information includes the information of restaurants, houses, transportation, and scenic spots around the campus. The MSN robot consists of three components: word segmentation and POS tagging, natural language understanding, and response text generation. The chat between the robot and students starts with an input of free-text question about campus information. Once the question is received, the natural language understanding component determines the meaning of the input question using classification methods. Finally, the output component generates a text response using a set of predefined templates. The MSN robot is implemented using the Dot MSN, an open source package that can connect the MSN Messenger service. The experimental results show that among several classification methods the support vector machine (SVM) achieves the best performance in classifying users' input questions into curriculum information or living information. © 2012 American Scientific Publishers.},

  abstract      = {Many natural language processing tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER), part of speech (POS) tagging, word segmentation, and etc., can be formulated as sequential data labeling problems. Building a sound labeler requires very large number of correctly labeled training examples, which may not always be possible. On the other hand, crowdsourcing provides an inexpensive yet efficient alternative to collect manual sequential labeling from non-experts. However the quality of crowd labeling cannot be guaranteed, and three kinds of errors are typical: (1) incorrect annotations due to lack of expertise (e.g., labeling gene names from plain text requires corresponding domain knowledge); (2) ignored or omitted annotations due to carelessness or low confidence; (3) noisy annotations due to cheating or vandalism. To correct these mistakes, we present Sembler, a statistical model for ensembling crowd sequential labelings. Sembler considers three types of statistical information: (1) the majority agreement that proves the correctness of an annotation; (2) correct annotation that improves the credibility of the corresponding annotator; (3) correct annotation that enhances the correctness of other annotations which share similar linguistic or contextual features. We evaluate the proposed model on a real Twitter and a synthetical biological data set, and find that Sembler is particularly accurate when more than half of annotators make mistakes.

In the second step, multiple segmentation schemes are integrated into a single SMT system by characterizing the source language side and merging identical translation pairs of differently segmented SMT models. Experimental results translating five Asian languages into English revealed that the proposed method of integrating multiple segmentation schemes outperforms SMT models trained on any of the learned word segmentations and performs comparably to available monolingually built segmentation tools. © 2011 The Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication Engineers.},

  abstract      = {One issue in natural language processing is the interaction between a rule-based computational morphology and a syntactic-semantic analysis system. This is because derivational and compound word forms raise the question of how to deal with ambiguities caused by the rule-based analyser, and how to add additional information like valency to a derivational or compound word form if its valency frames differ from those of its root word. In this paper we propose a lexicon design addressing both of these issues. We evaluate our design in the context of a large-scale morphological analysis system for German in which the lexicon serves as an interface between morphology and syntax. In doing so, we aim at enriching the wellformed analysis results with additional information so that an adequate syntactic-semantic analysis can be ensured.},

  abstract = {Given a text or collection of texts involving unconstrained language, a basic task in a multitude of applications is the identification of stems and endings for each word form, which is termed morphological analysis. In this paper, the use of an ant colony optimization (ACO) metaheuristic is proposed for a linguistic task that involves the automated morphological segmentation of Ancient Greek word forms into stem and ending. The task of morphological analysis is essential for implementing text-processing applications such as semantic analysis and information retrieval. The difficulty of the morphological analysis task differs depending on the language chosen, being hardest in the case of highly-inflectional languages, where each stem may be associated with a large number of different endings. In this paper, focus is placed on the morphological analysis of ancient Greek, which has been shown to be a particularly hard task. To perform this task, a system for the automated morphological processing has been proposed, which implements the morphological analysis of words by coupling an iterative pattern-recognition algorithm with a modest amount of linguistic knowledge, expressed via a set of interactions associated with weights. In an earlier version of the system, these weights were determined by combining the input from specialized scientists with a lengthy manual optimization process. In this paper, the ACO metaheuristic is applied to the task of defining near-optimal system weights using an automated process based on a set of training data. The experiments performed indicate that the segmentation quality achieved by ACO is equivalent to or in several cases substantially higher than that achieved using manually optimized weights.},

These model can be effectively applied to a natural language with a small character set, such as English, using character n-grams that are larger than trigrams. These models, which are language independent and can be effectively used for languages having word spacing, can also be used for word segmentation in the languages without explicit word spacing. These models, by generalizing the HMMs, can consider a broad context and estimate accurate probabilities.},

TAGH is based on a large stem lexicon of almost 80.000 stems that was compiled within 5 years on the basis of large newspaper corpora and literary texts. The number of analyzable word forms is increased considerably by more than 1000 different rules for derivational and compositional word formation.
