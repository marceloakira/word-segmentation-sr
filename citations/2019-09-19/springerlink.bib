abstract="TAGH is a system for automatic recognition of German word forms. It is based on a stem lexicon with allomorphs and a concatenative mechanism for inflection and word formation. Weighted FSA and a cost function are used in order to determine the correct segmentation of complex forms: the correct segmentation for a given compound is supposed to be the one with the least cost. TAGH is based on a large stem lexicon of almost 80.000 stems that was compiled within 5 years on the basis of large newspaper corpora and literary texts. The number of analyzable word forms is increased considerably by more than 1000 different rules for derivational and compositional word formation. The recognition rate of TAGH is more than 99{\%} for modern newspaper text and approximately 98.5{\%} for literary texts.",

abstract="The classifiers produced by the Transformation Based error-driven Learning (TBL) algorithm do not produce uncertainty measures by default. Nevertheless, there are situations like active and semi-supervised learning where the application requires both the sample's classification and the classification confidence. In this paper, we present a novel method which enables a TBL classifier to generate a probability distribution over the class labels. To assess the quality of this probability distribution, we carry out four experiments: cross entropy, perplexity, rejection curve and active learning. These experiments allow us to compare our method with another one proposed in the literature, the TBLDT. Our method, despite being simple and straightforward, outperforms TBLDT in all four experiments.",

The capacity of the edit distance algorithm in the task of words clustering and the ability of our method to generate the correct stem for Spanish was evaluated.

abstract="This paper presents a revised version of an unsupervised and knowledge-free morpheme boundary detection algorithm based on letter successor variety (LSV) and a trie classifier [1]. Additional knowledge about relatedness of the found morphs is obtained from a morphemic analysis based on contextual similarity. For the boundary detection the challenge of increasing recall of found morphs while retaining a high precision is tackled by adding a compound splitter, iterating the LSV analysis and dividing the trie classifier into two distinctly applied clasifiers. The result is a significantly improved overall performance and a decreased reliance on corpus size. Further possible improvements and analyses are discussed.",

In English, ParaMor's balanced precision and recall outperform at F1 an already sophisticated baseline induction algorithm, Morfessor (Creutz, 2006). In German, ParaMor suffers from a low morpheme recall. But combining ParaMor's analyses with analyses from Morfessor results in a set of analyses that outperform either algorithm alone, and that place first in F1 among all algorithms submitted to Morpho Challenge 2007.",

volume="49",
number="4",
pages="831--856",
abstract="Tswana, a Bantu language in the Sotho group, is characterised by an agglutinative morphology and a disjunctive orthography, which mainly affects the verb category. In particular, verbal prefixes are usually written disjunctively, while suffixes follow a conjunctive writing style. Therefore, Tswana tokenisation cannot be based solely on whitespace, as is the case in many alphabetic, segmented languages, including the conjunctively written Nguni group of South African Bantu languages. This paper shows how a combination of two finite state tokeniser transducers and a finite state morphological analyser are combined to solve the Tswana (verb) tokenisation problem. The approach has the important advantage of bringing the processing of Tswana, beyond the morphological analysis level, in line with what is appropriate for the Nguni languages. This means that the challenge of the disjunctive orthography is met at the tokenisation/morphological analysis level and does not in principle propagate to subsequent levels of analysis such as POS tagging and shallow parsing, etc. The tokenisation approach is novel and, when implemented and evaluated, yields an F1-score of 95Â {\%} with respect to a hand tokenised gold standard.",

Good segmentation results were obtained, the proposed system outperforming the other teams' systems. Furthermore, phonetic change rules were determined on the train set and employed in the alignment process, improving significantly the performance of the system.",

The system takes a plain list of words as input and returns a list of labelled morphemic segments for each word. Morphemic segments are obtained by an unsupervised learning process which can directly be applied to different natural languages. Results obtained at competition 1 (evaluation of the morpheme analyses) are better in English, Finnish and German than in Turkish. For information retrieval (competition 2), the best results are obtained when indexing is performed using Okapi (BM25) weighting for all morphemes minus those belonging to an automatic stop list made of the most common morphemes.",

There has been an increasing amount of work on text mining this literature, but comparing this work is hard because of a lack of standards for making comparisons. To address this, we worked with colleagues at the Protein Design Group, CNB-CSIC, Madrid to develop BioCreAtIvE (Critical Assessment for Information Extraction in Biology), an open common evaluation of systems on a number of biological text mining tasks. We report here on task 1A, which deals with finding mentions of genes and related entities in text. ``Finding mentions'' is a basic task, which can be used as a building block for other text mining tasks. The task makes use of data and evaluation software provided by the (US) National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI).",
